## Passport Authentication Express Application

Passport is a nodeJS package which helps in implementing the authenication in you application. In this we have tried for local authentication. We can also use some of the popular authenication provider like google, twiter, facebook etc. In this we have done both registration and authentication.

### Package Used

* Express is the framework to buld web application.
* Ejs is the templating engine.
* Mongoose is object modeling for our MongoDB database.
* Passport stuff will help us authenticating with different methods.
* Connect-flash allows for passing session flashdata messages.
* Bcrypt-nodejs gives us the ability to hash the password.
